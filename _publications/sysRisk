excerpt: 'We propose a credit portfolio approach for evaluating systemic risk and attributing it across institutions. The model is estimated from high-frequency CDS data. The approach captures risks from privately held institutions and cooperative banks, extending approaches that rely on information from the public equity market. We account for correlated losses between the institutions, overcoming a modeling weakness in earlier studies. A latent risk factor with heterogeneous exposures fitted on the implied default probabilities quantifies the potential for joint distress and losses. We apply the model to a universe of Dutch banks and insurers.'
