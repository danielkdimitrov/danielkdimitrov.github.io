excerpt: 'We propose a credit portfolio approach for evaluating systemic risk and attributing it across institutions. The model is estimated from high-frequency CDS data. The approach captures risks from privately held institutions and cooperative banks, extending approaches that rely on information from the public equity market. We account for correlated losses between the institutions, overcoming a modeling weakness in earlier studies.'
