excerpt: 'We propose a credit portfolio approach for evaluating systemic risk and attributing it across institutions. The model is estimated from high-frequency CDS data. The approach captures risks from privately held institutions and cooperative banks, extending approaches that rely on information from the public equity market. We account for correlated losses between the institutions, overcoming a modeling weakness in earlier studies.'

 We address the problem of regulating the size of banks’ macroprudential capital buffers by using market-based estimates of systemic risk combined with a structural framework for credit risk assessment. We develop a set of novel modeling mech- anisms through which capital buffers can be allocated across systemic banks: (1) equalizing the expected impact between a systemic and a non-systemic institution; (2) minimizing the aggregate systemic risk; (3) balancing the social costs and ben- efits of higher capital requirements. We apply the model to the European banking sector and find sometimes substantial differences with the capital buffers currently assigned by national regulators. Since capital buffers are one of the main policy instruments for managing banks’ potential contributions to systemic distress, our findings have substantial implications for systemic risk in the EEA.
