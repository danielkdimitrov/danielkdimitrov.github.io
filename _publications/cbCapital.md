excerpt: 'We propose a credit portfolio approach for evaluating systemic risk and attributing it across institutions. We construct a model that can be estimated from high-frequency CDS data. This captures risks from publicly traded banks, privately held institutions, and co√∂perative banks, extending approaches that rely on information from the public equity market only. We account for correlated losses between the institutions, overcoming a modeling weakness in earlier studies. We also offer a modeling extension to account for fat tails and skewness of asset returns. The model is applied to a universe of banks where we find discrepancies between the capital adequacy of the largest contributors to systemic risk relative to less systemically important banks on a European scale.'

In pursuing its mandate, a central bank assumes financial risks through its mon- etary policy operations. Central bank capital is a critical tool in mitigating these risks. We investigate the concept of central bank capital as a mechanism for risk- sharing with its shareholder. Adopting an option pricing framework, we explore the setting where the central bank commits to distributing dividends when its cap- ital is robust, while the shareholder may be called upon to recapitalize the bank during adverse economic conditions, with negative capital. Our analysis dissects the trade-offs inherent in these options, seeking a mutually beneficial agreement that disincentivizes deviation for either party. This equilibrium is essential for safe- guarding the independence and credibility of the central bank in executing monetary policy effectively.
